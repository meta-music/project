Project title:  MetaMusic - An emotional music community by writing Cognitive Diary

Project start: December 2021

Problem:  Help people with emotion regulation by music. (emotion such as: anxiety, stress and etc.)

Idea:  Develop and practice emotional regulation by music diary in an online community. (Tech including, Mobile App, ABC Model, Algorithmic Composition)

Intended impact: Mental sub-health people

The university of Hong Kong made a survey revealed:  [97% Hong Kong citizens have sub-optimal health](https://www.hkupop.hku.hk/english/report/subhealth/content/resources/pr.pdf)[^1], and statistical results of the Psychological Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences show that more than 70% of China is in mental sub-health. More and more people began to realize this warning signs, and go to the hospital. However, Especially in the mainland, there is a shortage of hospital-related resources, often takes 4 to 6 months to make an appointment, and mental health market is relatively lacking. Therefore, this project - MetaMusic, aims to help more people who are troubled by mental sub-health through IT and some other technology integration such as music diary, computerized [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-journaling-a-systematic-method-to-overcome-negative-beliefs-119be459842c)[^2] and shareable [improvisational music therapy](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/8817-music-therapy)[^3].

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychological treatment that has been demonstrated to be as effective as, or more effective than, other forms of psychological therapy or psychiatric medications for a range of problems including depression, anxiety disorders, marital problems, eating disorders, and severe mental illness. CBT places an emphasis on helping individuals learn to be their own therapists. Numerous research studies suggest that CBT leads to significant improvement in functioning and quality of life.[^6] However, CBT require some basic psychological skills and difficult to persist unless you are particularly good at self-regulation. 

People always not really get the meaning of their emotion, but can feel better when they listen to music. Music is the innate ability of human beings which can help most people to get better mental health. Moreover, developing and practicing emotional regulation by music diaries can integrate ABC model (or cognitive behavioral therapy) - help people to challenge and build better beliefs. With the development of technology, algorithmic composition and/or music games has become a new instrument that is most easy to learn and use - there are some open-source framework including [Tone.js](https://apps.musedlab.org/groovepizza/?museid=kngevZcmc&)[^4] and [magenta](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ai/ai-duet/view/)[^5]. Finally, this project will apply those open-source framework to develop a music diary app by gamifying CBT and improvisational music therapy, and the project will be open source, and all group operations, meeting records, activities, and plans are showing on [meta-music.github.io](https://meta-music.github.io/project/).
